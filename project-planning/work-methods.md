# Work Methods - Project Management

Processes for managing a project. 

* **Waterfall** (traditional method - major problems are lack of flexibility and tiome restraints often cause problems)
* **Agile** (Building in increments. Transparency is key. Adaptable to changing circumstances.)
* **Lean** (Popular with start ups - take all people out of the process who might be surpluss to requirements) 
* **Kanban** (tasks set in columns)
* **Scrum** (has a scrum master who protects the teams time, idea is to have sprints of high focussed work to complete the project)

** Every company differs. Some companies follow these theories strictly, some are more flexible.
