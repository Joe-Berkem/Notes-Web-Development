### 4.1 Relationships.

The DOM is a **tree** structure, meaning that the elements within it have the following relationships:

- **Parent** : the containing element
- **Child** : the contained element
- **Sibling** : other Child elements with the same Parent
```html
<html>
  <body>
  <h1>Lists!</h1>
  <p>A list</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/one">First Thing</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/two">Second Thing</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/three">Third Thing</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```


### 4.2 Traversal.

With the DOM you can get elements using their relationships to other elements:
```js
let body = document.body;// the <body>

let header = body.firstElementChild;// the first child of body, <h1>
let bodyAgain = header.parentElement;// the <body>

let p = header.nextElementSibling;// the <p>
let ul= p.nextElementSibling;// the <ul>
let headerAgain =p.previousElementSibling; // the <h1>
```
You can also get all the children:
```js
let listItems = ul.children;
```
This returns an HTML Collection, so you will want to convert it to an array before you do anything with it.

### 4.3 Selecting Children.

You can use many of the selection methods on any element:
```js
container.getElementsByClassName("menu__item");
container.getElementsByTagName("li");
container.querySelector("li a");
container.querySelectorAll("li a");
```
It can be much more efficient to select a container element (particularly if you use getElementById) and then use these methods to select child elements.

Itâ€™s also preferable to use the getElement...methods over the querySelector...methods where you can as they are generally much faster.
