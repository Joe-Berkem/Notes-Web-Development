A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

They're particularly helpful to give comments and different views so that the client or project team can agree on the approach before anything is prototyped.
